After following Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies for a few years, one thing became very obvious to me. The number one risk when investing is not hacking or security flaws, it's **user error**. It's so incredibly easy to lose access to your private keys.

# Steel Plates

These steel plates are designed to have a BIP39 24 word passphrase stamped onto them, using a letter punch kit, to allow recovery of crypto currency private keys. Whether for use with a software wallet, or a hardware wallet like the Trezor, having the recovery passphrase stamped onto corrosion-proof and fire-proof metal plates minimizes the risk of loss of private keys.

The plates can be ordered from [Lasergist](http://lasergist.com) using instructions below. They are laser-cut from 3mm stainless steel or any other thickness available on lasergist. Technically, the middle plate is the only one required and has laser markings indicating passphrase word ordering. By having additional plates cut, the passphrase can be hidden from sight and zipties can be added to prevent tampering. It also increases the weight of the whole assembly which helps prevent accidental misplacement.
